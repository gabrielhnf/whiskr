# 🐾 Whiskr

**A C(at)-based programming language written in C/C++!.**

Whiskr is (or will be) a basic programming language where everything is cat-themed — because why not? It's a purrfect excuse to explore how programming languages work under the hood.

> ⚠️ This project is more than anything a learning experiment, I'm figuring things out as I go — expect bugs, not-so optimized methods, and plenty of printf's, or `meow()`'s.

---

## ✨ Example (Eventually)

```whiskr
purrcedure myain() {
    paw name = "Whiskr";
    meow("Hello from " nyaa~ name);
}
```

 - myain() – your main function

 - paw – declare a variable

 - meow() – print to the console

 - nyaa~ – string concatenation (maybe)

> The project is still VERY early in development, so syntax is subject to change.
> And as such, feel free to leave syntax suggestions if you've got funnier (or cringier) puns than I do.

## 🛠 Goals

   - Write a basic lexer in C 🧵

   - Build a parser and simple AST

   - Compile to x86 assembly

   - Learn and document the process 🧠

---

## 🐛 Current Progress

 - [x] Lexer

 - [ ] Parser (work in progress)

 - [ ] AST + Interpreter

 - [ ] Basic stdlib

 - [ ] Example programs

 - [ ] (optional) FFI integration with C

---

## 🚧 Status

Still very early! I just started the parser and have got many things to learn, so no stable builds or documentation yet. If you're a kind soul who wants to help, feel free to open an issue or PR — or just leave some motivational meows.

## 💡 Inspiration

  * C (the language)

  * Cats 🐈

  * Just the two are enough. (The first one is debatable)
