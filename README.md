# 🐾 Whiskr

**A C(at)-based programming language written in C/C++!.**

Whiskr is a basic educational programming language where everything is cat-themed — because why not? It's a purrfect excuse to explore how programming languages work under the hood, including lexers, parsers, and interpreters or compilers.

> ⚠️ This project is currently a learning experiment, not meant for production use. I'm figuring things out as I go — expect bugs, hairballs, and plenty of `meow()`.

---

## ✨ Example (Eventually)

```whiskr
purrcedure myain() {
    paw name = "Whiskr";
    meow("Hello from " nyaa~ name);
}
```

 - myain() – your main function

 - paw – declare a variable

 - meow() – print to the console

 - nyaa~ – string concatenation (maybe)

> The project is still VERY early in development, so syntax is subject to change.

Feel free to leave syntax suggestions!

## 🛠 Goals

   - Write a basic lexer in C 🧵

   - Build a parser and simple AST

   - Interpret or compile to bytecode (TBD)

   - Learn and document the process 🧠

---

## 🐛 Current Progress

 - [ ] Lexer (work in progress)

 - [ ] Parser

 - [ ] AST + Interpreter

 - [ ] Basic stdlib (like meow())

 - [ ] Example programs

If you're curious about how programming languages work, feel free to poke around. This is all for educational purposes and will likely be messy, experimental, and full of trial and error.

## 🚧 Status

Still very early! I'm currently stuck wrangling the lexer, so no stable builds or documentation yet. If you're a kind soul who wants to help, feel free to open an issue or PR — or just leave some motivational meows.
